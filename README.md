# ADVENT OF CODE 2022
My solutions using scala3, with some coding rules :
- no side effects,
- no mutable data structure,
- readable, maintainable and easily understandable,
- only with the standard library except for ZIO-test used for unit testing.

Solutions :
- [day01](src/test/scala/day01/Puzzle.scala) - ok
- [day02](src/test/scala/day02/Puzzle.scala) - ok
- [day03](src/test/scala/day03/Puzzle.scala) - ok
- [day04](src/test/scala/day04/Puzzle.scala) - ok
- [day05](src/test/scala/day05/Puzzle.scala) - readability should be enhanced
- [day06](src/test/scala/day05/Puzzle.scala) - ok
